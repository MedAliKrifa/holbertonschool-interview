Imagine you have a bunch of locked boxes in front of you. You need to open all the boxes, but some boxes have keys inside that unlock other boxes. You start with the first box already unlocked.

To open all the boxes, you need to use the keys inside the boxes you have already opened to unlock other boxes. You keep track of the boxes you have opened in a list called open_boxes.

You also keep a list of keys you have found but haven't used yet in a list called unused_keys. You start with all the keys in the first box, and you add any new keys you find to the unused_keys list.

Then you try each key in the unused_keys list, one at a time, to see if it opens a new box. If it does, you add the new box to the open_boxes list, and you add any new keys you find in the new box to the unused_keys list.

You keep doing this until you have tried all the keys in the unused_keys list and haven't opened any new boxes. Then you check if you have opened all the boxes by comparing the number of boxes you have opened to the total number of boxes. If you have opened all the boxes, you're done! If not, you can't open all the boxes.
